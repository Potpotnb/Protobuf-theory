# Distributed Caching System: Simplified Implementation

Welcome to the **Distributed Caching System** repository! This project provides a practical implementation of a distributed caching system, focusing on essential concepts and features. It includes an LRU cache eviction policy, single-machine concurrent caching, an HTTP server, consistent hashing, distributed nodes, cache breakdown prevention, and Protobuf-based communication. This repository is designed to help you understand and build a basic yet functional distributed caching system.

## üìñ Overview

This project implements the following key features:

- **LRU Cache Eviction Policy**: Efficiently manage cache size by removing the least recently used items.
- **Single-Machine Concurrent Cache**: Support concurrent access to the cache in a single-machine environment.
- **HTTP Server**: Expose the cache functionality via an HTTP interface.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Distribute data across multiple nodes using consistent hashing for scalability.
- **Distributed Nodes**: Enable communication and coordination between multiple cache nodes.
- **Cache Breakdown Prevention**: Implement mechanisms to prevent cache breakdown under high load.
- **Protobuf Communication**: Use Protobuf for efficient and structured communication between nodes.

## üöÄ Features

- **LRU Eviction Policy**: Manage cache size effectively with the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.
- **Concurrency Support**: Handle multiple concurrent requests in a single-machine cache.
- **HTTP Interface**: Access the cache via a simple HTTP API.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Distribute data evenly across nodes for scalability.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Support multiple nodes working together as a distributed cache.
- **Cache Breakdown Prevention**: Protect the system from cache breakdown under high traffic.
- **Protobuf Integration**: Use Protobuf for efficient and type-safe communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- **Go 1.16+** (or the latest stable version)
- **Protobuf Compiler (`protoc`)**
- **Basic understanding of distributed systems and caching concepts**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   - Install the Protobuf compiler (`protoc`) if not already installed.
   - Install Go dependencies:
     ```bash
     go mod download
     ```

3. Compile Protobuf files:
   ```bash
   protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/cache.proto
   ```

4. Run the application:
   - Start testing demo (if applicable):
     ```bash
     bash main.sh
     ```
